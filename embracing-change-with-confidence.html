                                Embracing Change with Confidence
                            </h3>

                            <p class="mt-5 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">In the world of software development, change
                                is inevitable. Whether it’s
                                a new feature, a bug fix, or an optimisation,
                                every change introduces some level of risk. The common misconception is often that all
                                risk is inherently bad and
                                must
                                be avoided at all costs. In reality, a well-thought-out approach to assessing risk can
                                allow teams to make informed
                                decisions, enabling them to take calculated risks when necessary. The key is to assess
                                risk strategically using both
                                severity and impact, which can offer a more nuanced perspective on the potential
                                consequences of a change.

                                By understanding that not all risks are equal, teams can happily balance innovation with
                                stability.</p>

                                The Risk Spectrum: Severity vs. Impact
                            </h4>

                            <p class="mt-5 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">Risk in software development can be
                                understood along two key dimensions:</p>

                            <p class="mt-5 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">Severity and Impact.</p>

                            <p class="mt-5 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600"> Severity refers to the magnitude of the
                                issue. How bad is the problem if it
                                occurs? Does it break essential
                                functionality, or is it a minor inconvenience?</p>

                            <p class="mt-5 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600"> Impact refers to the scope of the
                                issue. Who will be affected if the problem
                                arises? Will it only impact a
                                small
                                subset of users, or does it affect a core feature used by everyone?

                                A critical issue in a small, rarely used feature might be of lower risk than a minor
                                issue in a key part of the
                                system
                                used by most of the user base. This risk model allows teams to assess the likelihood and
                                consequences of a potential
                                issue being introduced by a change. Let’s break this down further.</p>

                            <p class="mt-5 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600"><b>High Severity, Low Impact:</b>
                                Consider a change that could introduce a critical issue, such as breaking a feature.
                                However, this feature might
                                only be
                                used by a small fraction of the user base. While the severity of the issue is high, its
                                overall impact is low,
                                making
                                this risk somewhat manageable. If mitigation strategies are in place (such as feature
                                flags or targeted rollouts),
                                this
                                is a risk the team could reasonably take.

                            <p class="mt-5 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600"><b>Low Severity, High
                                    Impact: </b>Conversely, a minor bug or performance issue
                                in a heavily used feature could have a
                                significant impact on the user
                                experience. Even if the problem is a small UI glitch, if it occurs in a part of the
                                system that nearly all users
                                interact with, this introduces a high level of risk. In such cases, teams might consider
                                delaying the change or
                                prioritizing a fix before release.

                            <p class="mt-5 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600"><b>High Severity, High Impact: </b>These are
                                the most critical risks. A change
                                that could introduce a major bug in a widely
                                used feature demands the
                                highest level of scrutiny. The consequences could be severe, ranging from system crashes
                                to loss of data, which
                                could
                                severely affect customer satisfaction and trust. In this case, teams should either delay
                                the release or implement
                                comprehensive testing and mitigation strategies.

                            <p class="mt-5 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600"><b>Low Severity, Low Impact: </b>These
                                represent the least risky changes.
                                Minor bugs in rarely used features are
                                generally acceptable risks. However,
                                they shouldn’t be ignored — low-risk issues can accumulate over time and lead to
                                technical debt. Addressing these
                                issues
                                in a future sprint is typically a reasonable approach.

                                decisions about how to manage the risk involved with any change.

                            <p class="mt-5 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">Risk-based testing focuses testing efforts
                                on areas that carry the highest risk. By
                                understanding the areas of the
                                system that are most critical to the user experience or business operations, QA teams
                                can prioritise their tests
                                accordingly. High-severity, high-impact features should be subjected to the most
                                rigorous testing processes,
                                including
                                automated regression tests and manual exploratory testing, while lower-risk areas can
                                receive lighter coverage.

                            <p class="mt-5 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">For example, if a new feature is being
                                rolled out in a payment system, this would be
                                flagged as high risk and

                                exhaustive testing. On the other hand, a UI change to a settings page used by a fraction
                                of users may require
                                lighter

                                stakeholders collectively assess the potential risks of a change. Each team member

                                the guiding metrics, teams can confidently decide which risks are acceptable and which
                                require further mitigation or
                                testing.

                                development, but it doesn’t have to be feared. By
                                embracing a structured

                                innovate. Understanding the
                                relationship between severity and impact allows teams to make informed decisions about
                                which risks are acceptable
